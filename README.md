Euler
=====

Code for project Euler problems.

I have been playing with Euler Problems (http://projecteuler.net) for a
while and I think it worth to have a central repo to be able to share
the source code and libraries between my different working machines.

If you are trying to solve Euler Problems, please, do not copy this ones.
You want to solve them by yourself.
